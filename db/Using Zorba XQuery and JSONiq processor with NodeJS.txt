Hello,
I just created a basic module for node.js so you can use it with Zorba and therefore to use JSONiq,
to install it, make sure you have Zorba properly installed on your system, the use npm like:
npm install zorba
this will enable you the Zorba module within node.js, currently we have only a simple binding, like in this example:

var zorba = require('zorba');
try {
  var r = zorba.execute("Hello from Zorba for Node");
  console.log(r);
} catch (e) {
  console.log("error");
}

soon I will post references in our site, 
give it a try, 
if you have problems or suggestions, please! please let us know!
